# Analyzing-DNS-Log-Files-Using-Splunk-SIEM

Introduction
DNS (Domain Name System) logs are crucial for understanding network activity and identifying potential security threats. Splunk SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) provides powerful capabilities for analyzing DNS logs and detecting anomalies or malicious activities.

üîπ 1. What DNS events should look like

A ‚Äúgood‚Äù DNS log line should include at least these parts:

Source IP = the client making the query (e.g., 10.0.0.5)

Destination IP = the DNS server handling the query (e.g., 10.0.0.53)

Domain name (FQDN) = what was queried (e.g., example.com)

Query type = the record type requested (A, AAAA, TXT, ANY, etc.)

Response code = the server‚Äôs response (NOERROR, NXDOMAIN, SERVFAIL, etc.)


üîé Review Settings

Input Type: Uploaded File ‚úÖ
That‚Äôs correct for one-time/manual testing.

File Name: dns.log ‚úÖ
Just the file you picked. Nothing wrong here.

Source Type: dns_sample ‚úÖ
Good choice! This is what you‚Äôll use in searches (sourcetype=dns_sample).

Host: splunkvictor ‚ö†Ô∏è
That‚Äôs the hostname of the machine running Splunk.

## Uploading the DNS.LOG FILE

## Extract Relevant Fields
Identify key fields in DNS logs such as source IP, destination IP, domain name, query type, response code, etc.

## Identify Anomalies
Look for unusual patterns or anomalies in DNS activity.
Example query to identify spikes

## Find the top DNS sources
Use the top command to count the occurrences of each query type:

Investigate Suspicious Domains
Search for domains associated with known malicious activity or suspicious behavior.
Utilize threat intelligence feeds or reputation databases to identify malicious domains such virustotal.com
Example search for known malicious domains:
